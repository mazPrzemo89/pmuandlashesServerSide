# pmuandlashesServerSide
An ExpressJS server connected to a MongoDB database responsible for routing and CRUD operations.

## Database 
------
This project is using Mongoose.js for connecting to the db and all the necessary  data manipulation.
Every object saved in the database is a mongoose schema with a unique set of properties.

To run the server localy you need to have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
Alternatively you can connect to any active MongoDB cluster.
I have included a dummy .env file witch you can adjust to your needn.
